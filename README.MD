This is Conway's life on a PIC16F628a.

So what? Well the 628a is a very small microcontroller.
I managed to squeeze it in an OLED driver and the Life program in some 200 RAM.

Grid is 32x16. 

Probably works on other PIC's too. It is software driven.

Old school MPLAB used with the HI-TECH compiler.
You might wanna change some bits for the 'modern' stuff.

It is probably NOT BUG FREE
